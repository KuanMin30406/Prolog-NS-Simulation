# Prolog-NS-Simulation

A natural selection simulation type program for prolog. Users query the program with different input settings (Landscape, animal types, probability, days to simulate, pooulation, etc) and a result will be produced that will describe the end result of the simulation.

# Project Tasks
- Base simulation implemented (able to simulate up to N days given the starting population, rate of death per day, rate of birth per day, etc)
- Add more customizable features (Different enviornment or different animals each with unique properties, food availability that changes rate of birth or death, etc)
- Iteraction between animals/environment

# Bug backlog

# Extra
- Special queries where users can write certain sentences to ask for certain information on a simulation.

# Development Notes
- When writing the code try to add a comment on what the code is doing
- When pushing up the code into main branch, write the code in a separate branch and create a pull request instead (For possible code review before merge)
